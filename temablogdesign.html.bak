<h2> Rules for Autocomplete </h2>
<i>Posted on March 19,2019</i>
</div>

<div>
	<p>
Autocompleting text with known values seems line an easy problem to solve, but so so so many UIs get it wrong...<br/>
</br>
There may be cases where some of these rules aren't the best thing to do, but there should be a good reason for breaking one of these rules. 
Following these rules should always result in a very least a sane experience:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Exact matches always come first</li>
	<li>Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first</li>
	<li>After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches</li>
	<li>If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally...</li>
	<li>The action to make use of the section....</li>

</ul>
